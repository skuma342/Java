A) Install JDK on mac

Ref: https://gist.github.com/gwpantazes/50810d5635fc2e053ad117b39b597a14

$ brew tap                          # Check taps
$ brew tap homebrew/cask            # Tap into cask
$ brew tap homebrew/cask-versions   # Tap into cask-versions
$ brew update
$ brew search java
$ brew info java        # Double check information about the formula, such as JDK build version and OpenJDK.
$ brew install java     # Install the most recent stable feature release of OpenJDK

B) UPON JDK INSTALLATION, IT PRINTS SOME COMMANDS TO RUN.

For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  --> sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk

openjdk is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because it shadows the macOS `java` wrapper.

If you need to have openjdk first in your PATH run:
  --> echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openjdk you may need to set:
  --> export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openjdk/include"
  
  C) VERIFY USING COMMAND java -version
  
  D) Install intellij
  brew install intellij-idea-ce
  
  E)Launch the app
  open -na "Intellij IDEA CE.app"
